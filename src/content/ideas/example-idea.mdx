Every bookmark manager wants to be a cloud service. But I don't need my bookmarks synced across devices that badly.

What I want:
- **Offline first** - works without internet
- **Fast search** - instant fuzzy search across all bookmarks
- **Tags over folders** - one bookmark, many tags
- **Optional sync** - if I want it, on my terms

Could be a browser extension that stores everything in IndexedDB. Maybe uses CRDTs for conflict-free sync when/if you enable it.

Not sure if this is a "build it" or "use Raindrop.io" situation yet.

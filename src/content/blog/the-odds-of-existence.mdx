In Googling this number, I came across this post which I found valuable

>Because every single one of your ancestors, without fail, had to have lived long enough to have children and pass on their genes. A single break in that chain — death, not meeting, infertility, etc., and poof, you never existed. What are those odds? 1 in 10 to the 45,000th. A 10 with 45,000 zeroes after it. And the exact right sperm had to meet the exact right egg every time. Which now puts us at 1 in 10 to the 2,685,000th. I couldn't type that many zeroes in my lifetime, by a long measure.

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5rem; font-family: monospace; margin: 2rem 0;">1 in 10<sup>2,685,000</sup></p>

It's something I never really thought much about until turning 24 last year but it's an inconceivably small number

What's interesting on it is that since you didn't exist, you're not aware of the time passing in all of the moments that you don't exist

The other thing, is there's only ever been ~117 billion humans that have ever existed, think about how incredibly slim the chances are.

<div style="font-family: monospace; margin: 2rem 0; font-size: 0.875rem;">
<p style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">humans ever: 117,000,000,000</p>
<p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; word-break: break-all;">odds of you: 1{Array(2685000).fill('0').join('')}</p>
</div>

Nice job scrolling all the way to the bottom of that.

I've never been particularly religious, none of the major ones ever really spoke to me. But when I look at all of the interactions in the world, then I think about the chance of me existing at all, it makes me realize just how special live is and what a privilege it is that we get to live it.

I hated my old personal site. It was the classic portfolio template—career timeline, project showcase, the whole thing. Felt like a resume pretending to be a website.

So I nuked it.

This new version is simpler. Three things:

1. **Blog** - writing about whatever
2. **Ideas** - project concepts I'm thinking about, whether or not they ship
3. **Photos** - astrophotography from my backyard

No work history. No "hire me" energy. Just a place to share what I'm thinking about.

Built with Astro + MDX because I wanted something fast and simple. The old Next.js setup was overkill for a mostly-static site.

More to come.
